RiceOS 4.0 Web. It's a web-based operating system with access to a rudimentary web browser and a few other utilities such as a simple calculator and a music editor. It's built using Scratch and compiled to HTML using Turbowarp. I'm currently working on more features, such as a battery detector and (maybe?) even some more advanced functionality (or at least a better word editor or calculator, even before solid 3rd party apps or a file manager that works). Here's a picture of the desktop:
