RiceOS 4 lineup. They're all free, we-based operating system simulators, but with a very different feature set:
RiceOS 4 Web: basic features, but lightweight and not too complicated.
RiceOS 4 Pro: Pro features such as word editing, file browser, AI, consistent storage, and more, but removes the music app. 
RiceOS 4 Mobile: Pro features for mobile.
